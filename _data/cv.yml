    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Prof.Rose Yu’s Lab at Department of Computer Science and Engineering & Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute of UCSD
      year: 07/2022 - present
      description: 
        - The project builds a data-driven simulator (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2015.04.004) that combines simulation and real-world data that accurately predicts a patient’s Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and provides reference for optimal flow control of percutaneous ventricular assisted devices (pVADs)
        -  Reset blood pressure distribution to simulate original data, perform Sim2Real transfer to train a DANN model (Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks) in PyTorch, attempt to reproduce and verify previous simulation results on both myocardial infarctions (AMICGS) and high risk percutaneous coronary interventions (HRPCI) cohorts 
        -  Continue to investigate the performance of different deep learning models, compare performance of the conditional LMU encoder with DANN model by switching motor speed

      institution: Prof. Enfu Hui’s Lab at Department of Cell and Developmental Biology of UCSD
      year: 02/2019 - 05/2020
      description:
        - Studied how N and O glycosylation of CD80 contribute to the different binding levels between CD80 and CTLA-4, investigated the functional mechanism, and how it might affect the function of CTLA-4 as immune checkpoint and suppressive regulation of T cells
        - Designed CD80 mutants with different glycosylation sites with MegAlign software for DNA sequencing alignment and A plasmid Editor (ApE) for designing mutations
        - Cultured desired mutants in a variety of cells, employed the protein PD-L1 into the system to detect the glycosylation site affected by PD-L1/CD80 interactio
        - Utilized techniques and tools including PCR, spectrophotometer, western blot, ImageJ, protein quantification and purification, cell sorting, etc., applied FRET Assays to identify the results
