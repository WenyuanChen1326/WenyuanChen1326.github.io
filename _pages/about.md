Greetings! I'm Wenyuan Chen, but you can call me Sandy - the multi-passionate individual with a knack for blending human biology and data science. As a soon-to-be graduate of UCSD with dual bachelor degrees, my heart is set on using my skills to make a difference in the healthcare sector. My goal is to enhance patient outcomes by improving diagnosis accuracy and personalizing treatment plans.

When I'm not busy crunching numbers, I love to stay active and explore the great outdoors. Hiking and playing badminton are two of my favorite activities to stay fit and happy. Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a passionate food blogger? If you're feeling a bit peckish or looking for culinary inspiration, be sure to check out my delectable blog on [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5a151c6e11be103a6536af2d?xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=5a151c6e11be103a6536af2d&apptime=1677262765).

While English and Chinese are my go-to languages, I'm currently learning French and would love to practice my skills with a native speaker or anyone interested in exchanging language tips. So, whether you want to learn Chinese, practice French, or simply say hello, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'm always excited to meet new people!
